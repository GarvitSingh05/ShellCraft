I created these scripts just for fun, as i was learning and experimenting with linux and bash scripting in the fresher year of my college.

These scripts can save you time and effort, and they can help you to keep your system running smoothly.

Feel free to suggest any changes or corrections.

**Happy Scripting! ♥️**
